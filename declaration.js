// !variable types and Deceleration.
var x = 10 < 30 || 10 === 10;

let y = 11;

const z = 12;


console.log(x);
console.log(y);
console.log(z);

/* var can act like global variable but...
it could be problem because it can be multiple declaration.


let is block scope it's good and can be modified.


const it's also block scope it's good but it can't be modified.*/
